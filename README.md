### Hi there 👋 I am Bhanu Reddy 👨🏽‍💻 🇮🇳

- I 💙 building software products. It gives a lot of happiness when it helps others in multiple ways.
- 🔭 I’m working on improving JFrog Pipelines(CI product), which is part of JFrog JPD.
- 🏃 I am working on Golang, NodeJS & Typescript as part of my current assignment.
- 🚶 I have worked on ☕ Java and 🐍 Python in previous assignments.
- 🧑‍🚀 I am exploring TypeScript.
- 🐳 I know containers, K8S. I use docker and k9s almost every day.
- 🆒 I like to automate the boring stuff. It looks cool.
- 🐚 I have automated multiple small tasks using shell script. It is tough to debug.
