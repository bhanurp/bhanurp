### Hi there 👋 I am Bhanu Reddy

**bhanurp/bhanurp** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
-->
- I 💙 building software and like to see the software written by me helping others.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on improving JFrog Pipelines(CI & CD tool).
- 🐚 I am learning more about shell script.
- 🤔 I am exploring TypeScript.
- 🆒 I like to  automate boring stuff, it looks cool.
- 🏃 I have worked on Golang, Java, Python, and NodeJS.
- 📽️ I know containers, K8S. It is amazing to see how the invention of one product led to others.
