### About Me

💙 **Passionate Software Engineer**  
I love building software products that solve real-world problems and bring value to others. There’s nothing that gives more happiness than seeing the positive impact of a solution.

🔭 **Current Focus**  
Currently, I'm working on enhancing **JFrog Artifactory** user plugins and workers. In a previous role, I contributed to **JFrog Pipelines (CI/CD)**, part of the **JFrog JPD** platform, and worked on infrastructure services that are core to the platform.

🏃 **Languages I Speak (Code-wise)**  
I write code in **Java**, **Golang**, **NodeJS**, **Python**, and **TypeScript**. I like how each language has its own strengths, and I enjoy using different ones in my projects.

🐳 **Containers & Kubernetes Enthusiast**  
I work with **Docker** and **Kubernetes (K8S)** daily, and tools like **k9s** are part of my day2day workflow. Managing containers and orchestrating microservices is a fun challenge.

🆒 **Automation is My Jam**  
Automating tedious tasks is something I’m passionate about. I believe repetitive work becomes infinitely better when automated, and I constantly seek ways to improve efficiency.

🐚 **Shell Scripting Wizard**  
I’ve automated numerous tasks using **shell scripts**. While debugging them can be tricky, there’s a certain magic to the simplicity and power of shell commands. It’s like casting a spell—you have to get the syntax just right 😉
