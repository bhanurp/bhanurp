About Me

💙 Passionate Software Engineer
I love building software products that solve real-world problems and bring value to others. There’s nothing more rewarding than seeing the positive impact of a well-crafted solution.

🔭 Current Focus
Currently, I’m working on enhancing JFrog Artifactory user plugins and workers. In a previous role, I contributed to JFrog Pipelines (CI/CD), part of the JFrog JPD platform, and worked on infrastructure services that are core to the platform.

🏃 Languages I Speak (Code-wise)
I write code in Java, Golang, NodeJS, Python, and TypeScript. I appreciate the unique strengths of each language and love the variety they bring to my projects.

🐳 Containers & Kubernetes Enthusiast
I work with Docker and Kubernetes (K8S) daily, and tools like k9s are integral to my workflow. Managing containers and orchestrating microservices is a fun challenge I enjoy tackling.

🆒 Automation is My Jam
Automating tedious tasks is something I’m passionate about. I believe repetitive work becomes infinitely better when automated, and I constantly seek ways to improve efficiency.

🐚 Shell Scripting Wizard
I’ve automated numerous small tasks using shell scripts. While debugging them can be tricky, there’s a certain magic to the simplicity and power of shell commands. It’s like casting a spell—you have to get the syntax just right 😉
